# DRP-Project
This is code for my Directed Reading Program project. It consists of a single library, which calculates Kravchuk polynomials, the eigenmatrices for arbitrary Hamming Schemes, inner distribution vectors for a given sequence similarity thresholds, and Delsarte's Linear Programming Bound.
